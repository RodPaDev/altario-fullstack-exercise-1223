- **[#feat/payments-page](https://github.com/RodPaDev/altario-fullstack-exercise-1223/tree/feat/payment-page)**: Adds the payments page bonus feature, branched off [#feat/patrick](https://github.com/RodPaDev/altario-fullstack-exercise-1223/tree/feat/patrick).

## Time Spent

- Estimated total time on the exercise: ~8 hours. 

# Notes
I chose not to implement the CI/CD and live-sync (websocket) bonuses to keep the effort within a reasonable timeframe of around 8 hours. This allowed me to demonstrate my skills effectively without overextending myself.

I estimate that implementing a proper CI/CD pipeline, including deployment and infrastructure-as-code (IaC), would take around 4 hours. Adding WebSocket-based live synchronization could take an additional 4–6 hours. I’m more than happy to discuss what these implementations would entail in detail.
